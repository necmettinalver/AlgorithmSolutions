# Algorithm Solutions and My YouTube Channel

Hello! I'm Necmettin Alver, and I created this repository to share my algorithm solutions and accumulate YouTube videos where I explain these solutions in detail.

## Algorithm Solutions

This repository contains code for solving various algorithmic problems. Each algorithm question has its own folder, and the solution codes are located in these folders.

### File Naming

Each solution file is named based on the source of the problem:
- LeetCode: `lcNumber_problem_name.py`
- HackerRank: `hrNumber_problem_name.py`
  
This file naming convention makes it easy to identify which algorithm question each file corresponds to.

### Utilized Algorithms

- Dynamic Programming
- Hash Table
- Monotic Stack
- ...

Each algorithm question folder includes not only the solution but also the problem description and details about the algorithm used.

## YouTube Videos

I am currently in the process of accumulating videos, and I plan to share my YouTube channel in the future. Stay tuned for detailed explanations of my algorithm solutions on ...

I will keep updating my repository with new solutions and video content, so stay tuned!
